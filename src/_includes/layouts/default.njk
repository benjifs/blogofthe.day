		<h2>About Blog of the .Day</h2>
		<p>While most of your experience of the web may be with corporate-owned websites, there are many people
			bucking this trend with a rebellious act: creating and maintaining a personal website.</p>
		<p>Bloggers around the world talk about the consequential and the inconsequential, from one's failed attempt
			to make a recipe to an idea that challenges the way we think about social networking.</p>
		<p>Every day, Blog of the .Day highlights a new blog. The blog is chosen at random and a new one should be deployed daily via Netlify.
			<em>note: in May 2024 <a href="http://artlung.com/blogofthe-day/">Joe Crawford became the steward</a> of this project.
		<p>Want to add your blog to the list? Submit a pull request on the <a
			href="https://github.com/artlung/blogofthe.day">project GitHub page</a>.</p>
